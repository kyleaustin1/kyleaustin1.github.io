<p>
  <p>Dear Dover,</p>
  Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's iSchool to study for your undergraduate in 2020. I will answer your questions one by one, in<br>
  the following sections.<br>

  <header>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
      </header>
<p>
We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a<br>
 semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First semester: 29 August 2020</li>
   <li>Second semester: 22 January 2021</li>
   <li>Third semester: 2 May 2021</li>
 </ul>

<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>


<p>You can find more information about <a href="http://academiccatalog.umd.edu/about-university/academic-calendar/semester-calendar/"> important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

      <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    </header>

<p>
At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information studies. You seem<br>
like a committed researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
  <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases<br>
     (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
  <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other<br>
resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>

      <h2>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</h2>
    </header>

<p>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as follows, with<br>
definitions:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
  <dd>A large predator, <em>very</em> hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.</dd>
  <dt>The elk</dt>
  <dd>An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also frequently<br>
      visits the Banff centre for the arts.</dd>
  <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
  <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry is<br>
      instead the call of the red-tail.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For more of my research, see my <a href="http://umd.edu">research page.</a></p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Dr Terra Nova</p>
